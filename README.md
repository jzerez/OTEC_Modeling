## Abstract:
OTEC is a promising renewable energy source that can be continuously operated with minimal environmental impacts. It is not a new idea, but certain specifics are still not very well understood.

We have a few ideas about where we could take the project once we have established a model that seems to accurately represent the system when compared to actual systems or literature. These may be the addition of solar panels, different working fluids, operating conditions, and scale - we expect to have a better sense of what may be interesting after doing more research. A tangential but related idea may ask where does an OTEC system make sense to implement? Who would benefit from improvements to this technology?

We’ll review literature that benchmarks typical OTEC performance and compare the outputs of our model to those benchmarks. Once we validate the model, we will move on to answer some of the other questions that we laid out in the previous statement.

We hope that our model will help us answer questions about the effectiveness of OTEC systems as they continue to become a more enticing form of renewable energy.
